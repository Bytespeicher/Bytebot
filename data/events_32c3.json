But research about these projects and how they work generally doesn't take into account the value of anonymous participation.\r\n\r\n Moderating user-generated or peer-produced content has challenges and many services (Yelp, Google, Wikipedia, Cloudflare, etc) have turned to third party blacklists, real-name policies, and banning users of anonymity networks like Tor to handle real and perceived abuse issues.\r\nThe result of such decisions in aggregate means that the Internet offers uneven opportunities for participation and engagement.

Can the EU learn from its failures? Where and what is the European digital rights movement? How do we make our advocacy more successful?\r\n\r\nIn recent months, these fails have received a great deal of attention in the press – Oettinger’s Taliban attacks, Schroedinger’s net neutrality, the cybercybercyber war and the repeated repackaging of ACTA. \r\n\r\nIt is reasonable to say that in a complex system like the European Union, system failure is a perpetual risk. However, for the defence of human rights and, indeed, many other policy issues, limiting those risks is absolutely essential. This is why we want to explore how we can gain insights and use valuable information from recent fails to fix the EU’s vulnerabilities. Most importantly, if we wish to prevent the more serious failures in the future, we need to examine how and where our advocacy fails.\r\n\r\nAccess and European Digital Rights fight for digital rights at the EU level. Although we’re detecting and fighting a large number of failures that the European Union produces with regard to digital policy-making, we’re still very far from preventing the big fails. \r\n\r\nFor instance, instead of proposing real solutions to the migration crisis, the EU’s shortsighted vision focuses on border surveillance. Instead of an urgently needed reform of Europe’s privacy rules, its governments water down the protections for their citizens. Instead of safeguarding the open and neutral internet, the EU paves the way for discrimination by the big telcos. Instead of proposing evidence-based policies, the EU is trying to justify its proposals with evidence-making surveys. \r\n\r\nCertainly, Brussels is obscure, opaque, complicated and far away – but the decisions made there affect us all. Unfortunately, among the many reasons for a failing defense of human rights at EU-level is the political indifference and resignation in our community™, a lack of understanding of the Brussels maze, a lack of awareness of the extent to which our national governments are directly involved in the policy-making process and a lack of communication about what happens in Brussels. During our talk, we therefore want to explore the following questions: Where and why is the European Union failing? Can the EU learn from its failures?

Novel defense mechanisms like Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) and Code-Pointer Integrity (CPI) promise to stop control-flow hijack attacks. We show that, while they make attacks harder, attacks often remain possible. Introducing novel attack mechanisms, like Control-Flow Bending (CFB), we discuss limitations of the current approaches. CFB is a generalization of data-only attacks that allows an attacker to execute code even if a defense mechanism significantly constrains execution.","description":"Memory corruption plagues systems not just since Aleph1's article on stack smashing but since the dawn of computing. With the rise of defense techniques like stack cookies, ASLR, and DEP, attacks have grown more sophisticated but control-flow hijack attacks are still prevalent. Attackers can still launch code reuse attacks, often using some form of information disclosure. Stronger defense mechanisms have been proposed but none have seen wide deployment so far due to the time it takes to deploy a security mechanism, incompatibility with specific features, and most severely due to performance overhead.\r\n\r\nControl-Flow Integrity (CFI) and Code-Pointer Integrity (CPI) are two of the hottest upcoming defense mechanisms. After quickly introducing them, we will discuss differences and advantages/disadvantages of both approaches, especially the security benefits they give under novel memory corruption attacks. CFI guarantees that the dynamic control flow follows the statically determined control-flow of the compiled program but an attacker may reuse any of the statically valid transitions at any control flow transfer. CPI on the other hand is a dynamic property that enforces memory safety guarantees like bounds checks for code pointers by separating code pointers from regular data. Data-only attacks are possible both for CFI and CPI.\r\n\r\nCounterfeit Object-Oriented Programming (COOP) and Control-Flow Bending (CFB) are two novel attack mechanisms. COOP reuses complete functions as gadgets, mitigating several defense mechanisms and CFB bends the control flow along valid but unintended paths in the control flow graph of a program.

Students from Europe can simply write a proposal and apply for the REXUS/BEXUS programme, which is realised by an agreement between the German and Swedish space agencies, DLR (German: Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt) and SNSB (Swedish National Space Board, Swedish: Rymdstyrelsen). The Swedish share is furthermore accessible to teams from other European countries through ESA.\r\n\r\nFor REXUS, two sounding rockets are launched from northern Sweden every year, each one capable of carrying up to 5 experiments (max. experiment payload mass approx. 40kg) to an altitude of 80-90km. The experiments have to be engineered to withstand at least 20g of acceleration during ascent and descent, and experience milli-gravity when close to the apogee. In addition, the space specific thermal and vacuum environment need to be considered. Since the altitude is too low for reaching an orbit, the rocket motor and payload falls back to ground and is recovered by helicopters. The experiments are then returned to the student teams and the data from the 10min flight can be analysed, for instance, atmospheric measurements or technology demonstrators.\r\n\r\nSimilarly for BEXUS, two balloons per year are launched from the same location in Sweden and allow for carrying up to 12 experiments (max. 100kg). The balloon lifts the gondola with inside experiments to an altitude between 25-30km. After some hours of floating, the balloon is separated and the gondola descents on a parachute. The payload is then recovered by a helicopter and returned to the launch site by truck.\r\n\r\nDuring the talk we will present two experiments which we were involved in:\r\n- Fiber Optical Vibration Sensing Experiment launched on RX15 in May 2014, and\r\n- Advanced Receiver Concepts for ADS-B Experiment launched on BX18 in October 2014\r\nBeside this, we will explain, how other interested students can participate in the next REXUS/BEXUS cycle.\r\n","recording_license":"CC-BY-4.0-DE","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":5934,"public_name":"panic"},{"id":6347,"public_name":"sev"}],"links":[{"url":"http://rexusbexus.net","title":"REXUS/BEXUS"},{"url":"http://fovs.de/","title":"FOVS (RX15)"},{"url":"http://bexus-arca.de/","title":"ARCA (BX18)"}],"attachments":[]},{"id":7229,"guid":"6ef3da22-6e38-4997-b44d-e279907be98d","logo":null,"date":"2015-12-27T14:00:00+01:00","start":"14:00","duration":"01:00","room":"Hall 6","slug":"32c3-7229-plc-blaster","title":"PLC-Blaster","subtitle":"Ein Computerwurm für PLCs","track":"Security","type":"lecture","language":"de","abstract":"Unser Vortrag demonstriert einen PLC-only Wurm.

","description":"In the catalog of History the institution of public library is listed in the category of phenomena of which we humans are most proud. Along with free public education, public healthcare, the scientific method, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Wikipedia, free software… It’s one of those almost invisible infrastructures that we start to notice only once they go extinct. A place where all people can get access to all knowledge that can be collected seemed for a long time a dream beyond reach – until the egalitarian impetus of social revolutions, the Enlightment idea of universality of knowledge, and the expcetional suspension of the comercial barriers of copyright made it possible.\r\n\r\nThe Internet has, as in many other situations, completely changed our expectations and imagination about what is possible. The dream of a catalogue of the world – a universal access to all available knowledge for every member of society – became realizable. A question merely of the meeting of curves on a graph: the point at which the line of global distribution of personal computers meets that of the critical mass of people with access to the Internet. Today nobody lacks the imagination necessary to see public libraries as part of a global infrastructure of universal access to knowledge for literally every member of society. However, the emergence and development of the Internet is taking place precisely at the point at which an institutional crisis — one with traumatic and inconceivable consequences — has also begun.\r\n\r\nThe reactionary forces of the »old regime« are staging a »Thermidor« to suppress the public libraries from pursuing their mission. Today public libraries cannot acquire, cannot even buy digital books from the world’s largest publishers. The small amount of e-books that they were able to acquire they must destroy after only twenty-six lendings. Libraries and the principle of universal access to all existing knowledge that they embody are losing, in every possible way, the battle with a market dominated by new players such as Amazon.com, Google, and Apple.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, Canada’s Conservative Party–led government cut financial support for Libraries and Archives Canada (LAC) by Can$9.6 million, which resulted in the loss of 400 archivist and librarian jobs, the shutting down of some of LAC’s Internet pages, and the cancellation of the further purchase of new books. In only three years, from 2010 to 2012, some 10 percent of public libraries were closed in Great Britain. The phenomena of which we people are most proud are being undercut and can easily go extinct.","recording_license":"CC-BY-4.0-DE","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":6078,"public_name":"Marcell Mars"}],"links":[{"url":"https://www.memoryoftheworld.org/","title":"Memory of the World"}],"attachments":[]},{"id":7468,"guid":"c6f44cff-122c-44f3-bcf9-683577a67e85","logo":"/system/events/logos/000/007/468/medium/amigaworkbench.png?1443676547","date":"2015-12-27T18:30:00+01:00","start":"18:30","duration":"01:00","room":"Hall 6","slug":"32c3-7468-the_ultimate_amiga_500_talk","title":"The Ultimate Amiga 500 Talk","subtitle":"Amiga Hardware Design And Programming","track":"Hardware \u0026 Making","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"The Amiga was one of the most powerful and wide srpead computers in the late 80's.

He will take you through the different mechanisms that can be created, simple processes for fabricating soft robots, and methods for joining elements together into sophisticated assemblies.","description":"Soft robots are slowly trickling out of universities and labs into everyday life. Amazon is experimenting with installing soft grippers on robotic arms to pick any product off a warehouse shelf. DARPA just funded an extensive program to build soft exoskeletons for soldiers to enhance how much they can lift and how long they can march. My lab, Super-Releaser, is developing robotic spacesuit components for NASA as a subcontractor on a SBIR grant. On paper they might seem too complex to whip up at home, but if you’re the kind of person who loved Creepy Crawlers and have access to a 3d printer you can make your very own soft robots.\r\n\r\nLet’s take a step back to explain what a soft robot is and what they're good for. Most robots out there are made from hard parts like steel gears and plastic housings with the occasional rubber wheel or timing belt thrown in. When they respond to their environment it’s usually by reading sensors and using a processor to change their behavior accordingly. This responsiveness is called compliance. There’s another way to get compliance out of an engineered object, though: make the object soft. Everything from goat hooves to octopus tentacles, starfish suckers to human muscles, use softness and springiness to their advantage. When your robot responds to the environment by bending, say around the thing you’re trying to grip, getting a specific output, like putting that thing in a box to get packed up and shipped off, becomes a lot simpler on the computation side of things. Adding compliant mechanisms to your engineering toolbox can add huge problem solving power to any robotics problem you're trying to tackle.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I’m going to describe how I go about fabricating soft robots. There are lots of methods out there – from heat sealing, to stitching, to direct printing – but the method I prefer is casting. I like casting my robots from 3d printed molds because I can test multiple designs in parallel (just print out the different molds with, say, different wall thicknesses or numbers of ribs inside the actuators, all at the same time). It also allows me to experiment with designs in a context that matches the material I’d be using if production were scaled up for mass manufacture. Finally, if I decide I really like the robot I’ve created, making a dozen of them is just a matter of casting that same mold a dozen times.\r\n\r\nI’m going to go over the materials I use and where to find them online, how to go about designing your own soft robot, and some interesting problems in soft robotics that are just waiting for solutions. I’m going to be taking the audience from building the simplest actuators, to methods for fastening parts, to getting airtight seals even at high pressures, to putting everything together into a single-piece walking quadruped.","recording_license":"CC-BY 4.0","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":3128,"public_name":"Gianteye"}],"links":[{"url":"http://har.ms","title":"My Portfolio"},{"url":"http://superreleaser.com","title":"Super-Releaser"}],"attachments":[]}]}},{"index":1,"date":"2015-12-28","day_start":"2015-12-28T11:30:00+01:00","day_end":"2015-12-29T04:00:00+01:00","rooms":{"Hall 1":[{"id":7306,"guid":"f9d33869-f9a2-4570-9e9a-25c56e32082a","logo":"/system/events/logos/000/007/306/medium/pesthoernchen_weihnacht_250x250.png?1448117187","date":"2015-12-28T11:30:00+01:00","start":"11:30","duration":"02:00","room":"Hall 1","slug":"32c3-7306-jahresruckblick_des_ccc","title":"Jahresrückblick des CCC","subtitle":"","track":"CCC","type":"lecture","language":"de","abstract":"Wir werden einen Überblick über die Themen geben, die den Chaos Computer Club 2015 beschäftigt haben.

This vulnerability has already been exploited to gain root privileges and to evade a sandbox, showing the severity of faulting single bits for security. However, these exploits are written in native code and use special instructions that flush data from the cache.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we present Rowhammer.js [1], a JavaScript-based implementation of the Rowhammer attack. After presenting the native attack, we underline the challenges we faced to trigger the vulnerability from JavaScript, without any special instruction. Beyond DRAM, this attack also requires a very fine understanding of CPU cache internals, that are largely undocumented. We detail our findings on these undocumented parts, and the different steps that led to the attack from JavaScript. We also give an outlook on possible exploits, including gaining root privileges from JavaScript and performing fault attacks on cryptography.\r\n\r\nIn the last part, we extend our presentation with an overview of cache attacks, bridging the gap between hardware-fault attacks and side channels. In side-channel attacks, the attacker doesn't rely on a direct software compromise, but rather on passive observation of hardware characteristics when a victim process runs. In common with Rowhammer.js, these attacks use techniques to evict data from the last-level cache.\r\n\r\n[1] Daniel Gruss, Clémentine Maurice, Stefan Mangard.

Der Hitag S Transponder wird von dem Hersteller NXP in erster Linie für die folgenden Zwecke empfohlen: Wäscherei-Automation, Logistik, Lagerverwaltung und die Überwachung und Verwaltung von Tierherden. In der Realität werden Sie aber auch in Zutrittskontrollsystemen wie dem blueSmart-System der Firma Winkhaus eingesetzt.\r\n\r\nDer Hitag S Transponder bietet zwei Modi: Plain und Authentication. Im Authentication Mode ist der Zugriff auf den Speicher des Transponders erst nach einer erfolgreichen Authentifizierung möglich. Grundlage der Authentifizierung ist ein 48Bit Pre-Shared-Key. Für dieses Verfahren ist laut Hersteller leserseitig ein Krypto-Coprozessor erforderlich.\r\n\r\nIn diesem Vortrag  erläutern wir die unterschiedlichen, bei dem Hitag S, erfolgreich durchgeführten Angriffe zur Überwindung der Authentifizierung bzw. dem Brechen des verwendeten Schlüssels. Hierbei berücksichtigen wir sowohl deren chronologische Entwicklung als auch ihre steigende Komplexität. Neben einem einfachen Replay-Angriff, der uns bereits Zugang zu den auf dem Transponder gespeicherten Daten gibt, kann auch der verwendete Schlüssel gebrochen werden.

Wir sind in der Lage den Schlüssel zu brechen und Informationen wie das Kennwort zu ermitteln, obwohl diese zusätzlich vor Lesezugriff geschützt sind.

Hierbei ist es unerheblich, ob es sich um ein Online- oder Offline-System handelt. Keiner der uns bekannten 125 kHz Transponder verfügt über ausreichende Kryptographieverfahren, um derartige Angriffe abzuwehren. Daher ist, selbst bei starker Verschlüsselung der Daten auf dem Transponder, es immer möglich mit einem Emulator einen exakten Klon zu erzeugen.

Therefore, it is not too surprising that it has security problems. However, it turns out that it has way too many problems. In this talk, we introduce how you can freely send data in the cellular network, and how an attacker can perform caller spoofing and denial of service attacks on calls to disable the target’s calling. Furthermore, we explain how small implementation glitch on VoLTE may lead to break the whole cellular network down.","description":"Voice-over-LTE (VoLTE) is a newly adopted voice technology in the LTE network, whose functionality is similar to VoIP. Even though VoLTE works similar to VoIP, implementing it on the cellular network is not an easy problem because it needs many changes at each component of LTE. If these changes are not securely considered, this may lead to several security problems.\r\n \r\nIn the legacy 3G network, as data and voice are separate, the accounting policies are also different: data is charged based on byte usage, and voice, on time usage. However, in VoLTE, even though voice is delivered as a packet, it is still charged by time usage. Therefore, this strange accounting policy might open free data channels.\r\n \r\nAnother point is that voice signaling for VoLTE is not handled as in the legacy 3G network. Basically, a phone has two processors: an application processor (AP) which runs mobile OSes such as Android and a communication processor (CP) which manages digital signal processing and radio access. In 3G, voice signaling is handled in CP which makes an attacker hard to manipulate it. However, in VoLTE, because voice signaling is handled in AP, an attacker can easily analyze or modify the call flow. Furthermore, this new change can cause problems to the mobile OS.\r\n\r\nTo scrutinize these two points, we analyzed 5 operators, two in the U.S and three in South Korea. As a result, we found four free data channels. For free data channels, an attacker can inject data in the call signaling procedure or voice data transmission. Additionally, the attacker can freely send data to the Internet or to another phone in the cellular network through the VoLTE interface. Furthermore, we discovered five security problems which include no encryption of voice packets, no authentication of call signaling, no call session management, IMS bypassing, and permission model mismatch in Android. We responsibly disclosed all the vulnerabilities to US/KR CERTs and Google in May. We suggest mitigations for each vulnerability, and further propose possible attack vectors that researchers can study on.","recording_license":"CC-BY-4.0-DE","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":6204,"public_name":"Dongkwan"},{"id":6385,"public_name":"Hongil Kim"}],"links":[],"attachments":[]},{"id":7438,"guid":"144b2208-bf0b-494c-99e5-665ed18f1e8f","logo":null,"date":"2015-12-28T23:00:00+01:00","start":"23:00","duration":"01:00","room":"Hall 2","slug":"32c3-7438-goto_fail","title":"goto fail;","subtitle":"exploring two decades of transport layer insecurity","track":"Failosophy","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"Legend has it, the first iteration of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol was broken in ten minutes by Phillip Hallam-Baker and Alan Schiffman during a presentation by Marc Andreesen at MIT in 1994.

Also: iptables!","description":"We all know that writing large firewall rulesets can be hard. One huge problem. Let's write a tool to statically verify some properties of our rulesets! Now we have three huge problems:\r\n(1) writing flawless firewall rulesets.\r\n(2) making sure that our verification tool does the right thing.\r\n(3) making sure that the internal firewall model of our tool corresponds to the real world.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will solve these problems from front to back. We focus on problems (2) and (3). Warning: this talk involves math!\r\n\r\nFirst, we need to specify the behavior of the Linux netfilter/iptables firewall. In order to be convincing, this model must be small and simple. It should fit on one slide. However, firewalls can be quite complex and the model must cope with this. For example, looking at `man iptables-extensions`, we see numerous match conditions. But nobody required that our model must be executable code; we will specify the model mathematically. For example, this allows to define \u003ci\u003earbitrary\u003c/i\u003e match conditions. Technically speaking, we define the filtering behavior of iptables in terms of bigstep semantics. Mathematical specifications can be very powerful, in particular when we get to the point where the specification is not directly \"executable\".\r\n\r\nEnough math, let's write some executable code to do something with our ruleset. For example, unfolding the jumps to user-defined chains, checking that some packets will be certainly blocked, or checking that we got the spoofing protection right.\r\n\r\nSecond, based on our firewall model, we can now prove that our algorithms do the right thing. In contrast to testing, a mathematical proof allows assertions for all possible values. For example: For all possible packets, rulesets, and firewall-matching-features, our unfolding algorithm does not change the filtering behavior of the firewall. Yes, we can even show that our tool will still be correct, even if the netfilter team pushes a new matching feature.\r\n\r\nFinally, we now have a verified verification tool. We can use it to verify our firewall ruleset and finally sleep well at night again.\r\n\r\nWe developed an iptables verification library over the last few years in Isabelle/HOL. Isabelle can export executable definitions (i.e. our algorithms) to functional languages such as Haskell, Scala, SML, or OCcaml. Writing the input/output functions manually in Haskell, we have a fast and stand-alone tool.\r\n\r\nThis talk is also an introduction to interactive theorem proving and programming in Isabelle/HOL.

More people have created new kinds of businesses and solutions to create positive impact in the society instead of just bringing interests to the partners of the company. However, in the last two decades, most resources available to build solutions for international development challenges were provided to institutions in richer countries. Most of the solutions, therefore, were coming from outside the local context or community. There are very few examples that show low-income people as responsible designers for good solutions. Several reasons try to explain why this has happened, but one essential reasoning is the belief that well educated people have more capacity to reach a good solution for any context, even if these people do not belong to the local culture or context. However, the main results of this methodology are anything but understanding and positive. The four main results are: dependence, lack of user needs understanding, (and, as such) little or no sense of ownership, and lack of maintenance.\r\nIn order to address these four problems, different approaches to social innovation have started to be tested. One model that tries to explain these different approaches are called Design For, Design With, Design By. If this model is studied deeper, it is possible to recognize that it translates the passage from the donator solutions mindset to the capacity-building solutions mindset. The two main parameters to define to understand the difference between those approaches is “designer” and “user.” Design For expresses the fact the designer has very limited interaction with the user (typically only in the information gathering stage at the beginning and user testing at the end). This is typically what appropriate technology development looks like. Design With, also called co-creation and participatory development, brings together the user and the designer to understand the problem together, create solutions together and make decisions together in order to keep the project going forward. Design By defines the approach where the designer is also the user (and vice versa) or belongs to the same environment as the user. To test the Design By model, our Donor IDIN (www.idin.org) opted to support a local Innovation Center in a favela in Latin America, more specifically in São Paulo that the local organization Caos Focado has been responsible.","recording_license":"CC-BY 4.0","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":6084,"public_name":"Miguel Chaves"}],"links":[{"url":"bit.do/civneacontece","title":"ICVNE Youtube Channel"},{"url":"http://bit.do/civnehistoria","title":"ICVNE History Presentation"}],"attachments":[]},{"id":7231,"guid":"08843e46-b813-49a4-93ad-ab6e7b3e4a17","logo":null,"date":"2015-12-28T12:45:00+01:00","start":"12:45","duration":"01:00","room":"Hall 6","slug":"32c3-7231-cloudabi","title":"CloudABI","subtitle":"Pure capability-based security for UNIX","track":"Security","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"CloudABI is an alternative runtime environment for UNIX-like operating systems that is purely based on the principle of capability-based security.

In the first part we shall get an intuitive understanding of the language through familiar concepts from imperative programming. Introducing the syntax and semantics using simple examples. In the second part we shall scratch the surface of underlying theories such as the π-calculus, the λ-calculus, Linear Logic and Type Theory. Finally we shall see this language in action through a demo running a small game on the rad1o badge from the camp!","description":"The design of \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/np/ling\"\u003eLing\u003c/a\u003e is the result of my researches in collaboration with Daniel Gustafsson and Nicolas Guenot at the IT-University of Copenhagen and also from the language \u003ca href=\"https://lopezjuan.com/limestone/\"\u003eLimestone\u003c/a\u003e by Jean-Philippe Bernardy and Víctor López Juan at the University of Chalmers.  These two lines of research stand upon the longstanding research topics of process calculi (such as the π-calculus), term calculi (such as λ-calculus), Linear Logic, and dependent Type Theory (such as used in Coq and Agda to write proofs and programs).\r\n\r\nThe research on the λ-calculus and Type Theory gave rise to a powerful family of languages including but not limited to: Haskell, OCaml, Coq, Idris, and Agda. The research on the π-calculus gave rise to a vast family of calculi for concurrency. However type systems for these languages took much longer to emerge and progress. For instance the main concurrent programming language in use today is still dynamically typed. This is changing as we understand better how to the use the formulae of Linear Logic as behavior types (or session types) for concurrent processes.\r\n\r\nStill the aim of this experimental language is to program systems precisely and modularly. The need for precision comes from the resource constraints such as memory, file handles and the need for modularity comes the desire to reduce programming mistakes by solving problems at the right abstraction level. Functional programming offers a pretty good framework for modularity. This modularity comes at a cost which is rather difficult to predict. One the one hand optimizing compilers can fuse function composition to eliminate the need for intermediate data-structures. One the other hand when such an optimization fails to trigger the resulting program might poorly perform. The system of Ling controls when fusion can happen. Therefore one knows statically when fusion occurs and when intermediate buffers are needed.\r\n\r\nToday concurrent systems are built out of shared memory. However, the shared memory model is a nightmare for programmers. Here the approach is reversed we start from a concurrent programming language and apply it also for shared memory. At first the goal is not necessarily to target a parallel architecture but to program at level of abstraction where the programmer knows precisely the resources needed and the compiler still has plenty of opportunity to re-order and parallelize safely some instructions.\r\n\r\nThis talk is intended at an audience familiar with imperative programming. Using the language should not require to understand anything about Linear Logic even though it is used fundamentally. Finally this presentation is an open call for comments and contributions to the open development of the language and infrastructure.\r\n","recording_license":"CC-BY-4.0-DE","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":4179,"public_name":"Nicolas Pouillard"}],"links":[{"url":"https://github.com/np/ling","title":"github repository"},{"url":"https://nicolaspouillard.fr","title":"my homepage"}],"attachments":[]},{"id":7496,"guid":"341d7c6a-a8c0-47ec-8c24-4f6fc8639f3f","logo":"/system/events/logos/000/007/496/medium/op.png?1448634578","date":"2015-12-28T20:30:00+01:00","start":"20:30","duration":"01:00","room":"Hall 6","slug":"32c3-7496-hardsploit_a_metasploit-like_tool_for_hardware_hacking","title":"Hardsploit: A Metasploit-like tool for hardware hacking","subtitle":"A complete toolbox for IoT security ","track":"Hardware \u0026 Making","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"It is clear that something is needed to help the security community to evaluate, audit and control the security level of hardware products.\r\n\r\nHardsploit is a complete tool box (hardware \u0026 software), a framework which aims to:\r\n\r\n- Facilitate the audit of electronic systems for industry 'security' workers (consultants, auditors, pentesters, product designers, etc.)\r\n\r\n- Increase the level of security (and trust !) of new products designed by the industry","description":"Hardsploit is an all-in-one hardware pentesting tool with software and electronic aspects.

While PGP and S/MIME provide end-to-end encrypted mail, most users have yet to adopt these practices, and for users who have, these tools leave metadata, such as the subject, sender, and recipient, visible everywhere along a message’s path. SMTP\u0026mdash;the ubiquitous mail transport protocol\u0026mdash;has evolved over the years to add encryption and authentication, both of which take place behind the scenes and help guard against surveillance and spam. While these features are being increasingly deployed, our research shows that they are almost always configured in vulnerable ways\u0026mdash;the details of which are hidden from the users sending and receiving mail. Even more disturbingly, these vulnerabilities are being widely exploited in the wild: in seven countries, more than 20% of inbound Gmail messages are downgraded to cleartext by network-based attacks. In the most severe case, 96% of messages sent from Tunisia to Gmail are downgraded to cleartext. In this talk, I’ll introduce the commonly used SMTP security extensions\u0026mdash;including STARTTLS, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC\u0026mdash;and describe the current state of mail security on the Internet. I'll describe several commonly occurring attacks our recent research has found and discuss how mail operators can configure their servers to secure email transport. Finally, I'll discuss several weaknesses in the protocols we're using and recent proposals for helping secure email transport.","description":"\u003cp\u003eEmail carries some of our most sensitive communication, including private correspondence, financial details, and password recovery confirmations. We expect that messages are private and, in many cases, unforgeable. However, SMTP\u0026mdash;the protocol responsible for relaying messages between mail servers\u0026mdash;did not originally authenticate senders or encrypt mail in transit. Instead, servers support these features through SMTP extensions. Adopting these features is entirely voluntary and they have only been gradually adopted. As a consequence, mail servers still tolerate unprotected communication and will send messages in clear text if any problems occur when negotiating a secure connection.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eEarlier this year, I worked with colleagues at the University of Michigan and Google to measure the global adoption of email security features and try to better understand how well email is secured in practice.  Our study draws from two unique data sources: connection logs for Gmail spanning 16 months, plus a snapshot of SMTP server configurations from April 2015 for the Alexa Top Million domains. From Gmail’s perspective, incoming messages protected by TLS have increased 82% over the last year, peaking at 60% of all inbound mail. However, this improvement was largely because a small number of popular web mail providers deployed TLS\u0026mdash;many organizations still haven't deployed these features correctly. I will discuss these results and many more that reveal several major weaknesses in the global deployment of mail transport security.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis security patchwork enables network attackers to intercept and surveil email. In one kind of attack, actors corrupt the TLS handshakes at the the start of an SMTP connection to downgrade the connection to cleartext\u0026mdash;exposing messages to potential eavesdropping. Using Internet-wide scanning, we identified more than 41,000 SMTP servers in 193 countries that are routinely forced to deliver email as cleartext.  We analyzed the mail sent to Gmail from these hosts and find that in seven countries, more than 20% of all messages are prevented from being encrypted by active network attacks. In the most severe case, 96% of messages sent from Tunisia to Gmail are downgraded to cleartext, but even in Denmark, nearly 4% of messages are affected.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eIn a second class of attack, DNS servers provide fraudulent MX records for popular email providers. We searched for servers that provide fraudulent addresses for Gmail’s SMTP servers, and we find 14.6K publicly accessible DNS servers in 69 countries provide falsified responses. We investigate the messages that Gmail received from these hosts and find that in 193 countries more than 0.01% of messages from each country are transited through these impostor hosts. Six of the eight most-affected countries are in Europe.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n \r\n\u003cp\u003eIn this talk, I will first introduce the security extensions for SMTP and the current state of mail security. Then, drawing on our measurements, I will discuss the weaknesses in these protocols and the attacks we see occurring in the wild. I'll discuss what  mail server operators, developers, and even end users, can do to protect against these problems.

Many myths are fueled by misleading documentation. This presentation aims to provide simple and actionable information while explaining the core technical details and real world implementations.","description":"Randomness is as simple as critical. An application wants some bytes which an attacker can't predict. The clearest example is generating a cryptographic key, but a wide array of functions depend on randomness.\r\n\r\nAny time a key is generated, any time a DSA signature is made, any time the memory layout is randomized, applications rely on being able to create strings of bytes impossible to predict. If that comes short everything fails: cryptographic keys are compromised, exploits protections are ineffective.\r\n\r\nEntropy, the unpredictable raw material, is usually collected by the Operating System and exposed to the applications that need it. Once enough bits of entropy have been collected, it becomes impossible to predict the output of the CSPRNG (cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator), a stirrer of sorts that expands a seed into unlimited whitened random bytes, often based on stream ciphers or hashes.\r\n\r\nReal risks include trying to use a CSPRNG early on in the boot process, when not enough random events have been collected, or using a userspace CSPRNG instead of the kernel one and forgetting to seed it. Or using a non-CS PRNG.\r\n\r\nThat's just about it. However, there is a lot of misunderstanding on \"decreasing entropy\". It's a widespread myth that using random bytes decreases the \"amount\" of entropy. Reality is, to an attacker who's basically trying to predict the CSPRNG output there's no decrease in difficulty no matter how much output is drawn, so developers can avoid introducing additional complexity because of this.\r\n\r\nThis is all backed up by showing a simple toy CSPRNG design, and reasoning about its properties.\r\n\r\nMore practically, the points above translate into \"in Linux, just use /dev/urandom or the get_random syscall\". That's the kernel interface for the system CSPRNG. Its inner working are presented and they will hopefully make it clear why there is no meaningful difference from the \"counting\" /dev/random.","recording_license":"CC-BY-4.0","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":6145,"public_name":"Filippo Valsorda"}],"links":[],"attachments":[]},{"id":7401,"guid":"8becd5e2-45df-4723-9d6a-2e9f334875d2","logo":"/system/events/logos/000/007/401/medium/internetcube-poster-a3.png?1443648890","date":"2015-12-29T22:00:00+01:00","start":"22:00","duration":"00:30","room":"Hall 2","slug":"32c3-7401-internet_cube","title":"Internet Cube","subtitle":"Let's Build together a Free, Neutral and Decentralized Internet","track":"Hardware \u0026 Making","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"Two years after the invitation to build your own iSP at 30C3, I'd like to invite everyone to take part in building a better Internet with the Internet Cube project.\r\n","description":"At the crossroads of DIY Internet Access, Open Source Hardware and Self-Hosting Free Software, \"Internet Cube\" is the living proof everyone can regain control on their data.\r\nUsing a public and static VPN endpoint provided by a neutral and privacy-friendly ISP, the Cube enables the user to have her services accessible from everywhere simply by plugging it to the Internet.\r\nAssorted with a wireless antenna, the Cube operates as an ambulant cleaning gateway to the Internet, getting rid of whatever stupid thing a commercial ISP would be doing on the network like port blocking or service prioritization.\r\n\r\nThere are many other use cases enabled by already existing Y U NO HOST applications like turning the Cube into a PirateBox or a Tor gateway.\r\n\r\nWhen the first prototype came to life, someone said \"Well, congratulations guys, you've just built an actual working FreedomBox\" and I believe that what we built is more than that.","recording_license":"CC-BY 4.0","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":4175,"public_name":"taziden"}],"links":[{"url":"http://internetcu.be/","title":"Internet Cube"},{"url":"http://www.ffdn.org/en","title":"FFDN"},{"url":"https://yunohost.org/#/index_en","title":"Y U NO HOST"},{"url":"https://github.com/labriqueinternet/","title":"Source code"}],"attachments":[{"url":"/system/event_attachments/attachments/000/002/764/original/CEfYMBiWoAEr66x.jpg_large.jpeg?1443649095","title":"Internet Cube, AFK"}]},{"id":7413,"guid":"d961bd32-2c2a-45a5-bc58-64449bb4b16a","logo":"/system/events/logos/000/007/413/medium/Screen_Shot_2015-09-30_at_23.39.45.png?1443649924","date":"2015-12-29T22:45:00+01:00","start":"22:45","duration":"00:30","room":"Hall 2","slug":"32c3-7413-osterreich_der_kampf_gegen_unkontrollierte_massenuberwachung","title":"Österreich: Der Kampf gegen unkontrollierte Massenüberwachung","subtitle":"Geheimdienste kontrolliert man am besten, indem man ihre Gründung verhindert","track":"Ethics, Society \u0026 Politics","type":"lecture","language":"de","abstract":"Im April 2015 hat die österreichische Bundesregierung einen Entwurf für ein \"Polizeiliches Staatsschutzgesetz\" vorgelegt.

Der Widerstand gegen das Gesetz und die Kampagne des AKVorrat haben zwar zu mehrfacher Verschiebung der Beschlussfassung geführt, aber die Geheimdienstpläne der Regierung sind trotz mehr als 22.000 Unterzeichnerinnen und Unterzeichnern der Petition auf www.staatsschutz.at nach wie vor nicht vom Tisch. Der Talk bietet Einblicke, wie Geheimdienste in der Post-Snowden-Ära öffentlich und nicht öffentlich diskutiert werden.","description":"Wir zeigen die Geschichte von Österreich als Drehscheibe von internationalen Geheimdienstaktivitäten.

For example,\r\n    they are at the core of various Common-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) devices such as\r\n    printers, video surveillance systems, home routers and virtually anything we \r\n    informally call electronics. The emerging phenomenon of the Internet-of-Things\r\n    (IoT) will make them even more widespread and interconnected. Cisco famously\r\n    predicted that there will be 50 billion connected embedded devices by 2020.\r\n    Given those estimations, the heterogeneity of technology and application fields,\r\n    and the current threat landscape, the security of all those devices becomes of\r\n    paramount importance. In addition to this, manual security analysis does not\r\n    scale. Therefore, novel, scalable and automated approaches are needed.\r\n    In this talk, we present several methods that make *the large scale\r\n    security analyses of embedded devices* a feasible task. We implemented \r\n    those techniques in a scalable framework that we tested on real world data. \r\n    First, we collected a large number of firmware images from Internet \r\n    repositories and then performed simple static analysis. \r\n    Second, since embedded devices often expose web interfaces for \r\n    remote administration, therefore we developed techniques for large scale \r\n    static and dynamic analysis of such interfaces. \r\n    Finally, identifying and classifying the firmware files, as well as \r\n    fingerprinting and identifying embedded devices is difficult, especially \r\n    at large scale. \r\n    Using these techniques, we were able to discover a large number of new \r\n    vulnerabilities in dozens of firmware packages, affecting a great variety of vendors and\r\n    device classes.

This is the beginning of the full automation of the driving task. Vehicle manufacturers already showed first fully automated prototypes but a lot of challenges have to be addressed until such systems will be commercially available. One challenge is to provide the necessary information for the self-driving vehicle to make the right driving decisions. V2V communication is one possible technology to provide this information. The proposed talk is an introduction to the state of the art of V2V communication based on IEEE 802.11p.\r\n\r\nThis talk is a technical introduction to Vehicle2Vehicle communication. It will introduce the basic concepts of V2V technology and provides references to documents of the standardization. The talk will consist of the following parts:\r\n\r\nMotivation:\r\nThe talk starts by describing the scope and possible applications of V2V communication focusing on the use-case of the “Electronic Emergency Break Light”. What is more, V2V communication will be compared to traditional on-board sensors like Lidar or Radar.\r\n\r\nBasic concepts:\r\nThe state of the art concepts of V2V communication based on IEEE 802.11p and its differences compared to consumer WiFi will be discussed in this section. Furthermore, the existing concepts and standards developed in both Europe and the U.S. will be compared, with a special focus on the differences between the two approaches. In summary, the following questions will be addressed:\r\n•\tWhat are the approaches for V2V communication in Europe and the U.S.?  \r\n•\tHow is communication realized for V2V?\r\n•\tWhich standardization approaches exist and where can they be found?\r\n•\tWhat are the most important disseminated information and messages?\r\n•\tHow are these messages formatted? (header structure)\r\n•\tWhat are the differences between the V2V communication concepts in the U.S and Europe ?\r\n•\tWhich technical challenges have to be solved?\r\n\r\nPrivacy and Security:\r\nAs V2V communication will be used to broadcast the vehicle’s position and dynamic state, the privacy of the driver has to be protected. The talk will introduce the pursued concepts for privacy protection, whilst ensuring that only authorized entities are able participate in the communication. Due to the complexity of the topic, this section will focus on the concepts and the standards found in Europe.\r\n\r\nPerspective:\r\nEventually, the talk will address future work within the field of V2V communication, such as novel ADASs and privacy concepts.\r\n\r\nRemarks: The talk is only about the state of the art of V2V technology, its standardization and its further development.\r\n","recording_license":"CC-BY 4.0","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":5882,"public_name":"Bernd Lehmann"}],"links":[],"attachments":[]},{"id":7491,"guid":"371063d0-da9d-4d9f-bbe9-f5739eba2f30","logo":null,"date":"2015-12-29T17:15:00+01:00","start":"17:15","duration":"01:00","room":"Hall G","slug":"32c3-7491-de-anonymizing_programmers","title":"De-anonymizing Programmers","subtitle":"Large Scale Authorship Attribution from Executable Binaries of Compiled Code and Source Code","track":"Security","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"Last year I presented research showing how to de-anonymize programmers based on their coding style. This is of immediate concern to open source software developers who would like to remain anonymous. On the other hand, being able to de-anonymize programmers can help in forensic investigations, or in resolving plagiarism claims or copyright disputes. \r\n\r\nI will report on our new research findings in the past year. We were able to increase the scale and accuracy of our methods dramatically and can now handle 1,600 programmers, reaching 94% de-anonymization accuracy. In ongoing research, we are tackling the much harder problem of de-anonymizing programmers from binaries of compiled code. This can help identify the author of a suspicious executable file and can potentially aid malware forensics. We demonstrate the efficacy of our techniques using a dataset collected from GitHub.","description":"It is possible to identify individuals by de-anonymizing different types of large datasets. Once individuals are de-anonymized, different types of personal details can be detected from data that belong to them. Furthermore, their identities across different platforms can be linked. This is possible through utilizing machine learning methods that represent human data with a numeric vector that consists of features. Then a classifier is used to learn the patterns of each individual, to classify a previously unseen feature vector.\r\n \r\nTor users, social networks, underground cyber forums, the Netflix dataset have been de-anonymized in the past five years. Advances in machine learning and the improvements in computational power, such as cloud computing services, make these large scale de-anonymization tasks possible in a feasible amount of time. As data aggregators are collecting vast amounts of data from all possible digital media channels and as computing power is becoming cheaper, de-anonymization threatens privacy on a daily basis.\r\n \r\nLast year, we showed how we can de-anonymize programmers from their source code. This is an immediate concern for programmers who would like to remain anonymous. (Remember Saeed Malekpour, who was sentenced to death after the Iranian government identified him as the web programmer of a porn site.) We scaled our method to 1,600 programmers after last year’s talk on identifying source code authors via stylometry. We reach 94% accuracy in correctly identifying the 1,600 authors of 14,400 source code samples. These results are a breakthrough in accuracy and magnitude when compared to related work.\r\n \r\nThis year we have been focusing on de-anonymizing programmers from their binaries of compiled code. Identifying stylistic fingerprints in binaries is much more difficult in comparison to source code. Source code goes through compilation to generate binaries and some stylistic fingerprints get lost in translation while some others survive. We reach 65% accuracy, again a breakthrough, in de-anonymizing binaries of 100 authors.\r\n \r\nDe-anonymization is a threat to privacy but it has many security enhancing applications. Identifying authors of source code helps aid in resolving plagiarism issues, forensic investigations, and copyright-copyleft disputes. Identifying authors of binaries can help identify the author of a suspicious executable file or even be extended to malware classification. We show how source code and binary authorship attribution works on a real world datasets collected from GitHub.\r\n\r\nI hope this talk raises awareness on the dangers of de-anonymization while showing how it can be helpful in resolving conflicts in some other areas. Binary de-anonymization could potentially enhance security by identifying malicious actors such as malware writers or software thieves.\r\n \r\nI would like to conclude by mentioning two future directions. Can binary de-anonymization be used for malware family classification and be incorporated to virus detectors? Obfuscators are not the counter measure to de-anonymizing programmers. We can identify the authors of obfuscated code with high accuracy. There is an immediate need for a code anonymization framework, especially for all the open source software developers who would like to remain anonymous.","recording_license":"CC-BY-4.0-DE","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":3596,"public_name":"Aylin"}],"links":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK73oyI4Ygw\u0026feature=youtu.be","title":"Source Code Lightning"},{"url":"https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity15/technical-sessions/presentation/caliskan-islam","title":"Source Code Paper"}],"attachments":[]},{"id":7374,"guid":"b4339927-6780-4881-a342-e7a262078dce","logo":null,"date":"2015-12-29T18:30:00+01:00","start":"18:30","duration":"01:00","room":"Hall G","slug":"32c3-7374-the_architecture_of_a_street_level_panopticon","title":"The architecture of a street level panopticon","subtitle":"How drones, IMSI Catchers, and cameras are shaping our cities","track":"Ethics, Society \u0026 Politics","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"Street level surveillance technology, such as surveillance cameras and iris scanners, is now a pervasive part of the daily lives of city dwellers, with disastrous consequences for freedom of expression.

","description":"Surveillance was on the street before it was online, and that hasn’t changed. What has changed is that cities around the world are now bristling with street level surveillance technology, like GPS tracking devices, IMSI catchers, biometrics, drones, and cameras of all kinds. Much like the business of selling malware to repressive regimes, big multi-national corporations like General Electric and Morpho have made huge profits off the spread of this technology, and have helped it spread like wildfire.  \r\n\r\nEven in places like the United States, where, in the last 20 years, crime rates have steadily and significantly declined, the use of this incredibly invasive technology is excused by “public safety\" or \"crime prevention needs.” Justifications range from warnings about terrorism (often thinly-veiled jabs at activists like the Black Lives Matter movement or anti-austerity activists in Greece) to conflating “national security” with disaster preparedness. Similarly, In Latin American, government authorities  have used surveillance measures to discredit and stigmatize social movements involved in protests.  \r\n\r\nStreet level surveillance is also often part of preparation for major events. The technology left behind becomes integrated in to everyday policing. The 2012 Olympics in London was accompanied by a host of new technology, including iris scanners, biometric ID cards, automated license plate readers, and facial-recognition CCTV systems. In preparation for the 2014 World Cup Games, Brazil spent millions on CCTV, drones, facial recognition goggles, surveillance helicopters, and a mobile high-frequency radio wave scanner, as well as 14 digital command centers across the country (featuring huge ceiling-to-wall monitors to facilitate real-time monitoring of surveillance cameras.) The country also integrated their national and international databases with cooperating parties, like Interpol, and subjected Brazilians to this invasive data collection technique.  Intelligence agents mapped protest routes and monitored demonstrators by tracking their social media accounts. The 2016 Brazil Olympics are sure to make use of this technology—and provide an excuse for more.  \r\n\r\nThis talk will cover what kind of street level technology we’re seeing, how it’s spreading, and who’s making money off of it.

Researchers particularly in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer-Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) but also in the social sciences generally have begun to study hacking empirically—investigating hacking as a practice and as cultural phenomenon.\r\n\r\nHowever, Fefe, an influential blogger of the German hacking community, warned against collaborating with researchers: \r\n\r\n „In letzter Zeit gibt es eine auffällige Häufung von Befragungen und wissenschaftlichen Studien zu Hackern und Piraten, wie die Szene funktioniert und so weiter, auch bei Hackerspaces und insbesondere auch bei Gruppen wie Occupy und co. Wenn so jemand bei euch anklopft, sagt ihm bitte nichts. Nur weil die freundlich und nett wirken, muss man noch nicht kooperieren.\r\nNanu, hat der Fefe was gegen Wissenschaft? Nein. Aber was die meisten nicht auf dem Radar haben: Solche \"Studien\" werden von den Bösen gemacht. Dahinter stecken Public Relations Consulting-Firmen, Risk-Management-Firmen, Politikberatung, Thinktanks. Die haben Angst vor uns und wollen uns ausforschen. Und wie macht man das? Man schickt unverdächtige V-Leute. In diesem Fall nerdige Wissenschaftler, die freundlich anfragen.” (7.2.2013, blog.fefe.de/?ts=afed4222)\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will not be able to speak about undercover spying for corporate or government interest (because I don’t know any more about it than Fefe). Instead, this talk will be about the research that some of those ‘nerdy scientists’ that Fefe mentions do—researchers like my collaborator and me who thought: Hacking! Yes! That’s an interesting phenomenon, and it is important! For many social scientists, hacking is interesting because it challenges their academic thinking and their academic vision. It challenges the categories in which some research fields usually think (e.g., ‘the user’ as opposed to ‘the designer’). And it also can challenge how disciplines such as HCI (who perceive themselves as advocates for prospective users) envision themselves. \r\n \r\nThe talk offers a glimpse of the spectrum of research about hacking in HCI, CSCW, and adjacent fields. Researchers in these fields portray hacking very differently. The spectrum ranges from “transgressive craft” to “innovative leisure practice,” from skilled craftsmanship to ad hoc kludging, from an individualist pursuit to a community mission, from an expression of liberalism to an exclusive practice of cultural distinction. Some researchers see hacking as an illustration of how to defy technological determinism, i.e., the conviction that the technological determines the social, a position that social scientists typically fight ferociously. Other researchers see it as the future of “end-user innovation.”\r\n\r\nClearly, there is often vested academic interests in the ways in which social scientists portray hacking. In some cases, there is an interest in emphasizing the economic value of hacking, highlighting its creative and innovative potential. In other cases, there is an interest in emphasizing the pedagogical value of hacking, highlighting its potential as a means of teaching and learning. In still other cases, there is a conceptual interest in hacking or an interest in its cultural value. And yes, in some cases there is clearly an interest in simply preventing hacking. \r\n\r\nMy personal motivation to study hacking has a lot to do with my conceptual interest in notions such as ‘use’ and ‘design.’ Is hacking using, is it designing, is it both? And I find it interesting to note that hacking practices often react to a condition where the possibilities of ‘use’ are perceived as very limited. But my personal motivation to study and write about hacking in the HCI/CSCW community also stems from discontentment with the way in which HCI/CSCW research often sidelines the political visions of hacking—most notably, the vision of ‘open,’ community-driven technology that is an ‘expression of liberalism’ (Gabriela Coleman).\r\n\r\nMy motivation to give this talk is to communicate research back to those who are the subjects of research. The research discourse is, besides the mass media discourse, an important place for creating a public image of ‘the hacker.’ Moreover, I would like to discuss Fefe’s warning—“do not talk with researchers,” is that what 32C3 thinks? And what, after all, is hacking?\r\n","recording_license":"CC-BY-4.0-DE","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":5923,"public_name":"Susann Wagenknecht"}],"links":[],"attachments":[]},{"id":7202,"guid":"f4da28f8-1e28-45d4-9fab-d1d36d20ca7b","logo":"/system/events/logos/000/007/202/medium/2015-11-19_22.57.13.jpg?1447970345","date":"2015-12-29T22:45:00+01:00","start":"22:45","duration":"00:30","room":"Hall G","slug":"32c3-7202-stromtankstellen_eine_neue_offentliche_infrastruktur","title":"Stromtankstellen – eine neue öffentliche Infrastruktur","subtitle":"Was kann das?

They often portray hackers and hacktivists negatively and put them onto the same level with, for example, terrorists. This talk is based on a PhD research project examining the perception of self-identified hackers and hacktivists on these (in)securitising developments. It investigates how hackers and hacktivists understand themselves and their activities, explores how they articulate the effects of this (in)securitisation, and outlines the ways they resist these processes. ","description":"Within the public discourse, terms such as hacking and hacktivism are controversial. They are frequently equated with malicious activities and associated with the likes of cybercrime or cyberwarfare. Besides, both the activities and the actors standing behind these concepts are increasingly becoming subject to a threat construction. This process is understood as “(in)securitisation” which builds upon the idea that security issues do not necessarily reflect the objective, material circumstances of the world. Instead, what is considered as a “security threat” depends on the design of such a menace by a multitude of actors, e.g., politics, industry, or the media. \r\n\r\nThe talk uses this understanding to examine the perspective of hackers and hacktivists who have been subjected to this (in)securitisation. It is based on a sub-study which is part of a broader PhD project within the social sciences. It exhibits qualitative findings that are derived from interview data collected over the course of a Research Fellowship at the Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society, Berlin. A sample of N = 35 (female: n = 6; male: n = 29) self-identified hackers and hacktivists were therefore interviewed in German or English. The data was analysed using the method of thematic analysis. \r\n\r\nThis talk explains the theoretical background of the research project, the method used to analyse the data, and presents as well as discusses some of the research’s findings. It concentrates on the following issues: (a) how participants understand themselves and their activities, (b) how they articulate the effects of the (in)securitisation process, and (c) how they resist the (in)securitisation. Ultimately, the presentation gives an overview of what the (in)securitisation “does” to the hacker and hacktivist community, who - for the purpose of this research - have been studied conjunctively. It highlights how hackers’ and hacktivists’ self-understanding and perception stand in contrast to their current public representation, providing a relevant insight for the current debates about the possibility of re-articulating political rights online.","recording_license":"CC-BY-4.0-DE","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":5903,"public_name":"Leonie Maria Tanczer"}],"links":[],"attachments":[]},{"id":7386,"guid":"31331405-a243-48ba-9536-83285542400a","logo":"/system/events/logos/000/007/386/medium/coder-cat-cat.png?1443646739","date":"2015-12-30T12:45:00+01:00","start":"12:45","duration":"01:00","room":"Hall 1","slug":"32c3-7386-crypto_wars_part_ii","title":"Crypto Wars Part II","subtitle":"The Empires Strike Back","track":"Ethics, Society \u0026 Politics","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"Governments around the world are seeking to put a stop to secure end-to-end encryption, from the UK’s Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act, to Australia’s Defence Trade Controls Act, to India’s draft proposal to require plain text copies of all secure messages, to the United States’ Federal Bureau of Investigation’s public pressure on global companies like Apple and Google to weaken their security and provide law enforcement access to plain text content.","description":"Yet it is impossible to give these governments what they want without creating vulnerabilities that could be exploited by bad actors.

Despite their long-standing history, many still suffer from known\r\nattacks including bumping, impressioning, teleduplication, and rights \r\namplification. To mitigate these attacks, many lock systems rely on restricted\r\nkeyways and use blanks that are not sold to the general public, making it harder\r\nfor attackers to obtain them. Often the key blank designs themselves are\r\npatented, further discouraging distribution or manufacture by even skilled\r\nmachinists.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will investigate how rapid prototyping and 3D printing tools\r\ncan be used to attack modern lock systems. Even when manufactured on commodity\r\nmachines, 3D printed keys are now good enough to be used in a variety of\r\nattacks. We demonstrate this by showing several example attacks against popular locks, from 3D printing the TSA master key, to our own attacks against restricted key systems. To test the strength of modern 3D printed keys, we present results from our paper of a controlled analysis on a range of printed\r\nmaterials from plastic to metal, and show that it is possible to cheaply make or purchase 3D printed keys that are practically as strong as real keys. We also present a tool that can automatically\r\ncreate a CAD model of a key blank, given only a single picture of the front of \r\nthe corresponding lock. This tool makes the attacks that 3D printing enables\r\nagainst locks even easier and cheaper by no longer requiring skilled 3D design knowledge, and provides a warning to start looking\r\nfor alternatives to secure physical goods. Lastly, we describe defenses\r\nthat modern lock manufacturers can do to ensure their locks are not easily\r\nbypassed by 3D printing technology, including new lock designs, as well as putting more emphasis on existing designs that may resist 3D printing-enabled attacks for years to come.\r\n\r\nWebsite: https://keysforge.com/\r\nPaper: https://keysforge.com/paper.html","recording_license":"CC-BY 4.0","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":5283,"public_name":"Eric Wustrow"}],"links":[{"url":"https://keysforge.com/","title":"Website"},{"url":"https://keysforge.com/paper.html","title":"Paper"}],"attachments":[]},{"id":7356,"guid":"ff303155-f2fa-4c54-b9aa-ef47cd6e7704","logo":null,"date":"2015-12-30T12:45:00+01:00","start":"12:45","duration":"01:00","room":"Hall 2","slug":"32c3-7356-top_x_usability_obstacles","title":"Top X* usability obstacles","subtitle":"*(will be specified later based on usability test with Ivana Jilekova)","track":"Failosophy","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"What do you want?

A Social Media Break Up Coordinator goes through a clients social media accounts with the client, and helps block, unfriend, untag, and help ‚mute‘ old relationships and bad memories. \r\n\r\n„Social Media Break Up Coordinator“ will be presented as lecture over my performance which is debuting at Babycastles on Nov 21st, and 22nd. I am a user researcher and UX designer at IBM Watson. I work in conversational analytics and I help design systems and software layout for chat bots. I spend a lot of time thinking about the way systems and AIs ‚think‘ about and relate to words, context of conversations, and emotions. The way our social media systems are structured, there’s a fair amount of outlining and ‚work‘ users have to do when it comes to reporting online harassment, changing privacy settings, etc. But in that same vein, there's a lot the systems do for us- from suggesting users, suggesting content, to display of content, messaging, images, and events. All of those ‚things‘ are coming from content created by users, and are treated as data. But what is the context of it all? Facebook can see if a user removes a relationship status, but there isn’t a button or an algorithm for break ups. How do you a tell a system your child died or your heart was broken?\r\nThat’s where the Social Media Break Up Coordinator comes in. I will perform a series of paid events for my customers, who will also sign a legally binding. These services range from untagging the user and the ex or chosen person in specific images, moving friends of the ex/person and the ex/person onto a special list (to either mute, see less content, etc), crafting a series of emotional neutral messages to alert the other person that they are being unfriended/unfollowed/blocked for specific reasons, taking the number of the ex, deleting it from the client’s cellphone, and holding onto it for a specified amount of time decided upon between the client and myself. \r\nEffectively, the way to emotional navigate really ‚sticky‘ situations in social media is to have human intervention. Human emotions and relationships are complex and complicated, and require context, very deep context to understand. This is just something an algorithm cannot do. I’m interested in exploring emotional labor and the creation of new digital services and job to aid in this area of human relationships that have gone awry or death, as more and more users lives are lived and shared online, especially when algorithms began to fail with this kind of content.\r\n\r\nThe talk/lecture at CCC would feature documentation of my performance, research that I’ve done around blocking, muting, and a wide variety of social interactions (from abusive arguments with Gamergaters to navigating spaces with exes- ex boyfriends, girlfriends, best friends, and co-workers). I will also lecture on the structure of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram- and how the UI first fails with users when it comes to ‚de-couple‘ or ‚un-friend‘. I’ll then lecture how the algorithms fail, because all of the interactions of these are designed towards users interacting, not users completely separating from other users who may be very connected by friends and professional networks. What is the solution for this? My hypothesis is a series of newly created human roles, almost like a freelance life couch, to help the user get their digital lives in ‚order‘.

Since Snowden we know for sure that intelligence agencies have access to the data storage of an  service provider, either by (forced) cooperation, or espionage. Thus, to protect our privacy we have to encrypted our data before hand it over to our service provider (data holder). But this approach contradicts the very idea of a web service where the data holder have to process our data in one way or an other. Therefore, we need new cryptographic techniques to enable the\r\ndata holder to perform operation on encrypted data. One of the most important operations for cloud storage or database based web/cloud  services is the search operation.  In this talk we focus on the very familiar cloud storage scenario. Because in this scenario, It is obvious, that the user (data owner) do not want to perform the search by himself. This should be a service offered by the data holder.

Welche Auswirkungen hat das auf die Netzstabilität? Wann kommen die Stromnetze an ihre Leistungsgrenze? Wie kann ein gezielter Angriff auf das Europäische Verbundnetz aussehen? Was müsste man tun, um einen Blackout zu verursachen?

Dieses Kriterium setzt jedoch voraus, dass Betriebsmittel immer unabhängig voneinander ausfallen. Durch den Stromhandel, aber auch durch die vermehrte Einbindung regelbarer Lasten gibt es in Zukunft externe Ereignisse, welche die Ausfallwahrscheinlichkeiten mehrerer Betriebsmittel gleichzeitig beeinflussen. Dies kann vermehrt sowohl zu großflächigen (d. h. Bundesland aufwärts) als auch zu kleineren Ausfällen führen.\r\n\r\nDie Netzfrequenzmessdaten der Schnellabschaltung des Kernkraftwerks Gundremmingen liefert die Grundlage für ein Modell, mit dem das notwendige Lastungleichgewicht zur Destabilisierung des Verbundstromnetzes abgeschätzt werden kann.

Proprietary de facto standards of the dominant companies have lead to the emergence of virtual “information silos” that can barely communicate with one another. Has Diaspora really lost the war? Or is there still a chance to succeed?","description":"The Internet today is a giant web, a hilarious copy machine, interlaced into more and more aspects of our lives. What started as a network of equal nodes, has since transformed the layer above the open, decentralized hypertext protocol, and begun to move it towards greater centralization and power in the hands of few large platforms. Social networks are an important benchmark for this trend. \r\n\r\nSocial networks are an important tool for private, commercial and political use. Technological sovereignty can be decisive for political struggles, regardless of whether we talk about elections or revolutions. Privacy gains importance when the Internet becomes interconnected with more and more parts of our lives. The launch of Diaspora in 2010, a crowdfunded free-to-use social network based on free software, was clearly born from these debates. While the appeal of a federated system of social contacts is same in centralized and decentralized networks, they are worlds apart regarding their technical infrastructure, their power structures and their options for business models. \r\n\r\nMuch scientific work has been carried out on the technical challenges that decentralized social networks face. But the underlying economic mechanisms that drive the market towards concentration, promote the dominance of few actors and build high barriers for market entry, have so far been rarely addressed in the context of social networks. The dominance of one network is deeply rooted in the code of the market structure troubled with network effects, lock-in and proprietary de facto standards. Furthermore, privacy restraints through the operator derive from the very core of the business model of multi-sided markets as a bottleneck between users and advertisers. Lock-in and switching costs, make it difficult for users to leave their social network, thereby weakening competition. Such a structure enforces asymmetric power relations between users and providers systematically.  \r\n\r\nHere’s the thesis: Whoever wants to challenge the incumbent’s position needs to address these findings since this structure poses high barriers for market entry. Centralization of infrastructure on the market for social networks can not be reversed with technology alone. Decentralized social networks need foremost to consider how to breathe life into their provided infrastructure, since it is the user content and the interconnection between users that adds value and meaning to a social network. Projects that want to reintroduce technological sovereignty need good technology combined with a straightforward strategy for market entry. Some of these strategies differ substantially from standard strategies, since non-commercialized decentralized community driven projects based on the idea of free/ libre open source software differ in many aspects from companies. The fact that Diaspora built an alliance with other decentralized social networks of the Federation based on shared open standards is an important development and can be regarded as a good move towards joining forces against a paramount incumbent. It will be shown that although decentralized social networks face tough conditions entering the market for social networks, there are promising strategies that have not yet been exhausted. \r\n\r\nThe controversies which arose around the centralization in the market for social networks are now more pressing than ever. This talk shall present an overview of the impact of social networks and the driving economic forces of this market. The status quo of the Diaspora network and the Federation as the most prominent representative of free and open source non-commercial decentralized alternatives will be analyzed. Next, the economic analysis of the relevant market structures will be used to derive fresh perspectives on how this “new kid on the block” could develop a strategy for a successful market entry. The findings are supported by expert interviews with authorities in relevant fields and data from Diaspora and connected networks.","recording_license":"CC-BY-4.0-DE","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":6118,"public_name":"Katharina Nocun"}],"links":[],"attachments":[{"url":"/system/event_attachments/attachments/000/002/762/original/geraspora-data-analysis13.png?1443648938","title":"geraspora-data-analysis13.png"}]},{"id":7369,"guid":"abc3b46d-6e36-40e5-a037-79724a720183","logo":null,"date":"2015-12-30T14:00:00+01:00","start":"14:00","duration":"01:00","room":"Hall 6","slug":"32c3-7369-how_to_contribute_to_make_open_hardware_happen","title":"How to contribute to make open hardware happen","subtitle":"Mooltipass, Openpandora/Pyra and Novena/Senoko: how I contributed and what was to be learnt on the path","track":"Hardware \u0026 Making","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"What to do if you are neither a hardware- nor a software expert and want to contribute in effords of openess neverseless?

My own personal independent research of the Chinese internet and the popular Chinese social app, WeChat 微信, has contributed to an ongoing massive archive I began in 2014 called The Chinternet Archive. To date, I have over 15,000 pieces of content (and growing) documenting localized trends, memes, vernacular photography, online personas, .gif animations, videos, selfies, propaganda, retail, family/work life, and other such digital artifacts of online Chinese culture. This archive directly influenced my artistic and curatorial practice, resulting in an online art collection called Netize.net, or its Chinese name of 网友网 [wǎngyǒuwǎng] “Internet Friend Network”, which collaborates with emerging Chinese and international artists who are exploring or deconstructing East/West dichotomies, engaging in Sino-centric Web aesthetics, or investigating the East online. The goal of this talk is to explore through my Chinternet Archive and Netize.net collections, forms of creativity found in China in relationship to it’s early internet history, interactions with technology, localized networks and restrictions.","description":"Michelle Lee Proksell 媚潇 (b. 1985, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia) was born a Third Culture Kid (TCK) to ex-patriate American parents and experienced extreme forms of censorship and governmental monitoring in Saudi Arabia during her formative years. This influenced and shaped her interest and direction in exploring transcultural experiences online in relationship to localized access and dissemination of information, via forms of censorship or self-censorship. Her childhood exploring Asia and years working in new media and internet-related galleries and projects led to her eventual fascination with the unique history of the Chinese Internet. Since 2012 she has been working with creatives in China who engage in technology and the internet, resulting in two major projects documenting online digital artifacts and the emergence of Net Art in China:  The Chinternet Archive and Netize.net 网友网 “The Internet Friend Network”.\r\n\r\nIn this lecture, Michelle will briefly introduce Chinese digital media and online culture through her first hand experience and research. She will touch upon the topics of what it’s really like to deal with the Great Fire Wall on a daily basis, the influence of WeChat on contemporary Chinese digital culture, creative trends from her Chinternet Archive, and memes pertaining to recent viral media events. She will also introduce artists and their artworks from her Netize.net 网友网 project. She will reflect on how people are engaging creatively with the changes of the Chinese internet, how this influences artists and what we can learn from localized networks and the increasingly blurred lines between real life and virtual life.\r\n","recording_license":"CC-BY-4.0-DE","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":5997,"public_name":"Michelle Proksell "}],"links":[{"url":"www.netize.net","title":"Netize.net 网友网 \"Internet Friend Network\""},{"url":"https://www.wired.de/collection/latest/so-sieht-der-digitale-alltag-china-aus","title":"Chinternet Archive \u0026 Netize.net quoted \u0026 mentioned in WIRED Germany"},{"url":"http://www.vice.com/read/chinas-first-net-art-exhibition-113","title":"Netize.net: Creativity on the Chinese Web, VICE news article"},{"url":"http://www.thespace.org/news/view/ben-valentine-aspartime-net-art","title":"Workout with Chinese Net Art: The Space (news article from the UK)"}],"attachments":[]},{"id":7520,"guid":"269e7320-2133-4981-9238-e5fc8305a3e4","logo":null,"date":"2015-12-30T17:15:00+01:00","start":"17:15","duration":"00:30","room":"Hall 6","slug":"32c3-7520-compileroptimierungen_fur_forth_im_microcontroller","title":"Compileroptimierungen für Forth im Microcontroller","subtitle":"Mecrisp intern","track":"Hardware \u0026 Making","type":"lecture","language":"de","abstract":"Wie lassen sich Konstantenfaltung und ein Registerallokator für einen Forth-Compiler implementieren, der in einem Mikrocontroller läuft ?","description":"Wer gern mit Elektronik und Mikrocontrollern bastelt, kennt sicherlich die aufwändige Fehlersuche mit vielen kleinen Testprogrammen. Doch es ist auch möglich, einen Forth-Compiler direkt im Microcontroller zu installieren, mit dem über ein Terminal kommuniziert werden kann und welcher es erlaubt, \"von innen heraus\" auf die Hardware zuzugreifen sowie jede neu geschriebene Routine sofort von Hand auszuprobieren. Forth ist ein alter Hut - wer jetzt jedoch an langsam denkt, mag überrascht sein: Ein optimierender Forth-Compiler mit Konstantenfaltung und Registerallokator passt mit 20 kb Größe sogar in den LPC1114FN28 ! Wie die Optimierungen \"an Bord\" funktionieren, soll in diesem Vortrag erläutert werden. Assemblerkenntnisse für MSP430 und ARM Cortex M sind von Vorteil. Wer Forth genauer kennenlernen möchte, kann gern auch zur Assembly der Forth-Gesellschaft kommen.","recording_license":"CC-BY 4.0","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":6237,"public_name":"Matthias Koch"}],"links":[{"url":"mecrisp.sourceforge.net","title":"Mecrisp"}],"attachments":[]},{"id":7555,"guid":"7bf4c7a5-779e-4591-8d9b-f5f38d3dc879","logo":null,"date":"2015-12-30T18:00:00+01:00","start":"18:00","duration":"01:00","room":"Hall 6","slug":"32c3-7555-32c3_infrastructure_review","title":"32C3 Infrastructure Review","subtitle":"","track":"CCC","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"The traditional review event with presentations from various teams at congress.
